        Downhill skiing: Downhill skiing is another great way to take in the scenery. Ukko-Koli is the biggest (230-m vertical drop) and most demanding ski resort in southern Finland and challenges even the most experienced skiers. Ukko-Koli has six slopes, which can be accessed from Koli Nature Centre Ukko and Break Sokos Hotel Koli. There is also a chairlift from the shores of Lake Pielinen to the top of Ukko-Koli, and it is worth going up to admire the views even if you do not want to ski.<a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/kolinp/activities">Read more</a>

        Natural Features:Birch-dominated slash-and-burn forests, clearings and steep cliffs are examples of Koli's diverse natural features. If you venture to the forest, you will encounter dark, mysterious spruce forests on the eastern side of Lake Pielinen and lush herb-rich forests along the brooks. When snow covers the landscape in the winter, the spruces with crown snow loads create peculiar shapes on the hilltops. On the summits and western slopes you can also roam in rugged pine forests.<a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/kolinp/nature">Read more</a>
