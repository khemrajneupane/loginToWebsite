                    <p>2018 will bring marjor changes to the Finnish running field. Helsinki City Running Day will take place May 19th and it will include the iconic Helsinki City Marathon, which will move there from its original place in August. Two new events are introduced the same day: Marathon Relay and Helsinki City 5. Day will also host Helsinki City Run Half Marathon and Minimarathon for the kids.

                    The Marathon Relay is a great way to share the atmosphere of a marathon among a team. The team consist of 4 people. Two legs will be shorter and the other two longer ones. The relay changing areas are planned in a way that they are easily reached with public transportation. The daily ticket of the Helsinki public transportation is included in the entry fee.

                    The Marathon Relay’s purpose is to be an easy-going team race. Each team will run joint time. The Marathon Relay will have the split times each 10 kilometers, just like the marathon event. 

                    The organizer has used especially the Frankfurt Marathon Relay as a benchmark event. In Frankfurt the leg transition areas are made by going around an extra loop mainly outside of the route. In Helsinki the transition area will be located alongside of the route. Therefore, the route will not get longer than the full marathon.

                    The transition from one leg to the next one will be smooth in Helsinki. The timing system works with a bib tag attached to the bib number. Runners may use a baton, but it is not necessary. 
                    Just like in Frankfurt, there will not be separate equipment storage at the transition areas. Each team will take care of their teammates’ equipment during the race.

                    The registration for the Marathon Relay will open on the 11th of August 2017. The registration fee will start from 120 euros/team and will increase in price steps. The aim is to keep the price level fairly low. The organizer hopes that this encourages different kinds of teams to join the marathonrelay, including groups of friends, coworkers or sport club teams.</p><a href="http://www.helsinkicitymarathon.fi/en/news/new-event-marathon-relay-may-19-2018">Read more</a>

                        <blockquote><cite><a href = "http://www.helsinkicityrun.fi/en/news/your-bib-number-key-succesful-half-marathon"><mark>Helsinki City Run</mark></a></cite></blockquote>

                    <p>Your bib number is one of the most important things in your race day! Here is what you need to know about your bib number, starting groups and the timing zip!</p>

                    <h3>STARTING GROUPS</h3>
<p>Runners have now been divided into starting groups according to target times given while registering for the event. There is ca. 1000-1,500 runners in each group and altogether we have 10 starting groups. The start group number and color will be printed to the personal bib number and the runner must start with the group given. Each starting group will get together at Mäntymäenkenttä 15 minutes before their starting time and move to the starting line on their turn. The first starting group will start at 3 pm and the following starting groups every 10 minutes after that.</p>

                    <h3>WHY IS THE BIB NUMBER SO IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>Your personal timing chip is attached to your bib number and it will determine your official half marathon result. Bib number needs to be attached to the front of your shirt, so that it is clear and visible during the whole race. Your start time will be registered when you cross the starting line with your bib number. Each runner will be given the net time and the gross time. The gross time (from firing of the gun to crossing the finish line) is the official result of the race. The net time is the time from crossing the starting line to crossing the finish line. Remember also fill in ICE (In Case of Emergency) phone number and personal medical information on the back side of the bib number.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ASK YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO COME AND CHEER</h3>
<p>This year the runner´s name will be printed to the bib number, which will make it easier for the spectators to cheer along the route! Ask your friends and family to join the fun! There will be many cheering points on the route!</p>
